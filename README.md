# U.S. Tobacco Use Data Visualization Project
This project explores smoking trends and prevalence in the United States using a dataset containing smoking rates by state and demographic group over time. The project includes various visualizations created in Power BI, including maps, charts, and tables, that allow users to explore and compare smoking rates across different regions and demographics. The project aims to provide insights into smoking patterns and help inform public health policies aimed at reducing tobacco use in the United States.

# Data
The data used in this project was sourced from CDC and includes smoking rates by state and demographic group from 2011 to 2019. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI to create the visualizations.

# Visualizations
The visualizations created in Power BI include:

Interactive maps that allow users to explore smoking rates by state and demographic group
Clustered column charts that compare smoking rates across different demographic groups
Stacked bar charts that show changes in smoking rates over time

# Future work
Future work for this project could include:

Incorporating data on smoking-related health outcomes to further explore the impact of smoking on public health
Developing additional visualizations, such as scatterplots or heatmaps, to further explore smoking trends over time
Incorporating external data sources, such as data on tobacco sales or tobacco industry marketing, to provide additional context to the smoking trends observed in this dataset
